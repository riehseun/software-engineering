    "# 5. Facebook messenger\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functional\n",
    "\n",
    "- Supports 1-on-1 conversation between users.\n",
    "- Tracks online/offline status of users.\n",
    "- Persists chat history.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Non-functional\n",
    "\n",
    "- Minimum latency when chatting.\n",
    "- Consistency: same chat history from all devices.\n",
    "- Availability could take hit for preserving consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Extended\n",
    "\n",
    "- Support group chats.\n",
    "- Notify users of new messages when they are offline.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Design\n",

    "\n",
    "### When user A sends a message to user B.\n",
    "- Server receives the message and send ack back to A.\n",
    "- Server stores the message into DB and sends message to B.\n",
    "- B receives the message and sends ack back to the server.\n",
    "- Server notifies A that the message has been delivered.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to handle message\n",
    "- If users poll the servers to see if new messages, polling needs to be frequent to minimize latency for users and most polling would return empty response. \n",
    "- If active users keep connection with the server, users can receive messages as soon as servers receive messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to keep connection\n",
    "- HTTP long polling: servers hold client requests until there is some response to send back. If timeout, client must send new request.\n",
    "- If servers fail, users should reconnect.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to track open connections\n",
    "- Servers can use hash table where key is UserID and value is connection object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to handle offline user\n",
    "- Servers can notify sender that delivery has failed.\n",
    "- If receiver connects back, servers can ask sender to retry.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How many servers are needed\n",
    "- Assume 500M connections and one server can handle 50k concurrent conecctions. Then, 10k servers are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to know which server has which user connection\n",
    "- Use load balancers in front of servers that map UserID to server.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to maintain sequence of messages\n",
    "- Attach sequence number to every message for each client.\n",
    "    - Different user may see different sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Which DB to use\n",
    "- RDBMS (MySQL) or NoSQL (MongoDB) are not good because we need to do frequent read/write.\n",
    "- Choose wide-column DB like HBase. HBase stores data into memory buffer and move data into disk when buffer is full. This works well with variable-sized data.\n",
    "- Store multiple copies of data in different servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to manage user status\n",
    "- When users start the app, pull friends status from servers.\n",
    "- When users start chatting with other users, pull status at that time.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/facebookmessenger2.png\" style=\"width:700px;height:500px;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design summary\n",
    "- Clients open connection to servers to send messages.\n",
    "- Servers send messages to requested users.\n",
    "- All active clients keeps connection to servers.\n",
    "- Messages are stored in HBase.\n",
    "- Clients pull relevant user status from servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Group chat\n",
    "- Have mapping between GroupChatID to the list of users in the group chat. \n",
    "- Chat servers can interate the list of users to deliver the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Capacity\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume \n",
    "- 500M daily active users.\n",
    "- Each user sends 40 messages per day.\n",
    "- 100 bytes per message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Storage\n",
    "- 500M * 40 messages = 20B messages per day.\n",
    "- 20B messages per day * 100 bytes = 2TB per day.\n",
    "- For 5 years, 2 TB * 365 days * 5 years = 3.6 PB\n",
    "\n",
    "Bandwidth\n",
    "- 2TB / 86400s = 25MB/s \n",
    "- Each message is going to other users, so need the same bandwidth for upload and download.\n",
    "\n",
    "## API\n",
    "\n",
    "## DB\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data paritioning\n",
    "\n",
    "- Partition based on UserID hash.\n",
    "- All messages of a user is stored in the same DB.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Caching\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cache recent messages in recent conversations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Load balancing\n",
    "\n",
    "- In front of chat servers and cache servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## DB cleanup"
