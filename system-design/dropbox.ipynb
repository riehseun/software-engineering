    "- Store data on remote servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functional\n",
    "- Users can upload/download photos/videos from any device.\n",
    "- Users can share files/folders with other users.\n",
    "- Automatic sync betweeen devices.\n",
    "- Support large files up to 1GB.\n",
    "- ACID required.\n",
    "- Support offline editing.\n",

    "## Non-functional\n",
    "\n",
    "## Extended\n",
    "- Support snapshotting data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Design\n",
    "- Read/write will be huge.\n",
    "- Read/write raio will be similar.\n",
    "- Files should be stored in small chucks. (assume 4MB)\n",
    "- Transfer updated chucks only.\n",
    "- Keep file metadata on client to save traffics.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Client\n",
    "- Internal metadata DB: keeps metadata in the client to save round-trips to update remote metadata.\n",
    "- Chunker: splits files into small pieces. Also, reconstruct a file from its chunks. \n",
    "- Watcher: monitors workspace and notify Indexer of any user actions. Listens to changes in other clients.\n",
    "    - When listening to changes, use HTTP long polling where servers hold the client request open and respond when new information is available. \n",
    "- Indexer: processes events from Watcher and updates internal metadata DB. Also, updates remote DB via talking to remote sync service.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metadata DB\n",
    "- Choose relational DB like MySQL for ACID.\n",
    "- Information such as chucks, files, user, devices, workspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sync service\n",
    "- Sync client metadata DB and remote metadata DB.\n",
    "- To tranfer metadata, divide files into 4MB chucks and transfer modified chucks only. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Message queue\n",
    "- Handles communication between clients and sync service.\n",
    "- One global queue (Request Queue) to handle client request to update metadata DB.\n",
    "- One queue for each client (Response Queue) send update message back to client.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Block storage\n",
    "- Stores chunks of files.\n",
    "- Clients directly interact with storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### File processing\n",
    "- Client A uploads chucks.\n",
    "- Client A updates metadata.\n",
    "- Client A gets ack and client B and C get the notification.\n",
    "- Client B and C download metadata changes and chucks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data deduplication\n",
    "- For each incoming chuck, calculate its hash and compare it to hashes of all exising chucks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Security\n",
    "- Store file permission in metadata DB to configure who can read/write.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/dropbox3.png\" style=\"width:600px;height:400px;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## Capacity\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assume \n",
    "- 500M total users, 100 daily active users.\n",
    "- Each user connects from 3 different devices.\n",
    "- Each user has 200 files/photos, so there we have 100 billion total files.\n",
    "- Average file size is 100KB. We have 100B * 100KB = 10PB\n",
    "- 1M active connections per minute.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data partitioning\n",
    "- For partitioning metadata, use consistent hashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Caching\n",
    "- On block storage to deal with hot chucks.\n",
    "- On block servers to see if chunks are already in cache.\n",
    "    - Use LRU eviction policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Load balancing\n",
    "- Between clients and block servers.\n",
    "- Between clients and metadata servers.\n",
    "- Round robin."
