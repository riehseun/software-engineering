    "# Youtube\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirement\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functional\n",
    "\n",
    "- Users can upload, share, view, like/dislike, search videos.\n",
    "- Users can add, view comments.\n",
    "- Users can view thumbnauls, number of views.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-functional\n",
    "\n",
    "- High availability. \n",
    "    - Consistency can take a hit. \n",
    "    - For example, subscribers need not get notifications for uploaded videos immediately.\n",
    "- High reliability.\n",
    "- High scalability.\n",
    "- Performance\n",
    "    - Users should not feel lag watching videos.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Traffic\n",
    "- Assume\n",
    "    - 1000 videos are uploaded every minute.\n",
    "    - Ratio of upload:view is 1:100. \n",
    "        - Every uploaded video gets 100 views.\n",
    "- Video uploads: 1000 per minute.\n",
    "- Video views: 1000 * 100 = 100k per minute.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Storage\n",
    "- Assume\n",
    "    - Each video before encoding is 1GB and 10 minutes long. \n",
    "        - After encoding, size becomes 100MB.\n",
    "        - 1 minute video takes 10MB storage. (Compressed)\n",
    "        - 1 minute vidoe takes 1GB storage. (Uncompressed)\n",
    "- 10MB * 1000 = 100GB per minute.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Bandwidth\n",
    "- Incoming (upload): 1G * 1000 = 10TB per minute. (Video is uncompressed during upload)\n",
    "- Outgoing (stream): 10MB * 100k = 10TB per minute.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Server\n",
    "- Assume\n",
    "    - 1B active users and 100M daily active users.\n",
    "    - A single server can handle 10k connections.\n",
    "- 100M / 10k = 10,000 servers are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Design\n",
    "- User uploads video.\n",
    "- Server sends video to encoder.\n",
    "- Server sends user data and metadata to DB.\n",
    "- Encoder encodes video and store it in storage.\n",

    "## API\n",
    "\n",
    "- upload_video(user_id, video_file, title, description, tags, default_language)\n",
    "    - Return 202 on success.\n",
    "- search_video(user_id, query, user_location, length, max_videos_to_return)\n",
    "    - Return JSON with the list of videos.\n",
    "- stream_video(user_id, video_id, resolution)\n",
    "    - Return stream.\n",

    "## Design\n",
    "- Load balancer: distribute user load.\n",
    "- Web server: take user request, decouple client request from business logic, cache frequently accessed pages.\n",
    "- App server: business logic.\n",
    "- User DB: user related data, decoupled from metadata storage for easy scalability.\n",
    "- Metadata DB: video related data.\n",
    "- BigTable: thumbnail storage.\n",
    "    - Combines multiple files into one block to store.\n",
    "    - Very efficient for large number of small files with low retrieval latency.\n",
    "- Encoder: compress vidoes and generate thumbnail.\n",
    "- Blob storage: store vidoes.\n",
    "- CDN: forward videos to closer proximity to serve users faster.\n",
    "\n",

    "### How to manage read traffic\n",
    "- Segregate read traffic and write traffic.\n",
    "- Distribute read traffic to different servers.\n",
    "- For video metadata, write to primary and read from secondary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metadata sharding\n",
    "- Store based on UserID? It is hard to maintain uniform distribution because some users upload more than others.\n",
    "- Store based on VideoID? Solves above problem. Can cache hot vidoes in front of DB servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deduplication\n",
    "- When users upload vidoes, run video matching algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Load-balancing\n",
    "- Consistent hashing between cache servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Caching\n",
    "- Store hot vidoes in cache servers.\n",
    "- Use LRU eviction rule."
