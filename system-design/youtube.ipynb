    "# Youtube\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirement\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functional\n",
    "\n",
    "- Users can upload, share, view, like/dislike, search videos.\n",
    "- Users can add, view comments.\n",
    "- Users can view thumbnauls, number of views.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-functional\n",
    "\n",
    "- High availability. \n",
    "    - Consistency can take a hit. \n",
    "    - For example, subscribers need not get notifications for uploaded videos immediately.\n",
    "- High reliability.\n",
    "- High scalability.\n",
    "- Performance\n",
    "    - Users should not feel lag watching videos.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assume\n",
    "- 2B total users and 1B daily active users.\n",
    "- Each user watches 10 videos per day.\n",
    "- Each video before encoding is 1GB and 10 minutes long. \n",
    "    - After encoding, size becomes 100MB.\n",
    "    - 1 minute video takes ?MB storage.\n",
    "    - 1 minute vidoe takes ?MB bandwidth.\n",
    "- 10000 minutes worth of videos are uploaded every minute.\n",
    "- Ratio of upload:view is 1:100. \n",
    "    - Every uploaded video gets 100 views.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Traffic\n",
    "- Video views: 1B * 10 = 10B videos per day.\n",
    "- Video uploads per second: 10B / 100 = 100M per day.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Storage\n",
    "- 100MB * 1000 = 100GB per minute.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Bandwidth\n",
    "- Incoming (upload): 100GB per minute.\n",
    "- Outgoing (stream): 100GB * 100 = 10TB per minute.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Design\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/youtube1.png\" style=\"width:800px;height:400px;\"> \n",
    "\n",
    "- Processing queue: each uploading video shall enter this queue first. \n",
    "- Encoder: encode each uploaded vidoe into different formats.\n",
    "- Thumbnails generator: generate thumbnaul for each video.\n",
    "- Video and Thumbnail storage: store video and thumbnail.\n",
    "- User Database: store user information.\n",
    "- Video metadata storage: store video metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/youtube2.png\" style=\"width:800px;height:500px;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## API\n",
    "\n",
    "- upload_video(api_dev_key, video_title, video_description, tags[], category_id, default_language, recording_details, video_contents)\n",
    "    - Return 202 on success.\n",
    "- search_video(api_dev_key, search_query, user_location, max_videos_to_return)\n",
    "    - Return JSON with the list of videos.\n",
    "- stream_video(api_dev_key, video_id, offset, codec, resolution)\n",
    "    - Return stream.\n",
    "- view_thunbnail()\n",
    "- comment_video()\n",
    "- like_video()\n",
    "- dislike_video()\n",
    "\n",
    "## DB\n",
    "- Store video metadata in relational DB.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Video\n",
    "- VideoID\n",
    "- Title\n",
    "- Description\n",
    "- Size\n",
    "- Thumbnail\n",
    "- Uploader\n",
    "- Total number of like\n",
    "- Total number of dislikes\n",
    "- Total number of views\n",
    "\n",
    "### VideoComment\n",
    "- CommentID\n",
    "- VideoID\n",
    "- UserID\n",
    "- Comment\n",
    "- TimeOfCreation\n",
    "\n",
    "### User\n",
    "- UserID\n",
    "- Name\n",
    "- Email\n",
    "\n",
    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Where to store videos\n",
    "- HDFS\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to manage read traffic\n",
    "- Segregate read traffic and write traffic.\n",
    "- Distribute read traffic to different servers.\n",
    "- For video metadata, write to primary and read from secondary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Where to store thumbnail\n",
    "- Bigtable\n",
    "    - Combines multiple files into one block to store.\n",
    "    - Very efficient reading small amount of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metadata sharding\n",
    "- Store based on UserID? It is hard to maintain uniform distribution because some users upload more than others.\n",
    "- Store based on VideoID? Solves above problem. Can cache hot vidoes in front of DB servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deduplication\n",
    "- When users upload vidoes, run video matching algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Load-balancing\n",
    "- Consistent hashing between cache servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Caching\n",
    "- Store hot vidoes in cache servers.\n",
    "- Use LRU eviction rule."
